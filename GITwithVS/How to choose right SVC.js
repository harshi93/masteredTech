// Git is based on directed acyclic graph

// Some of the most prominent SVC systems are
// CVS, Subversion, Mercurial, Bazaar, 
// Team Foundation Version Control, Visual Source Safe, Git

// Choosing SVC depends on workflow, team work pattern,
// team thought process, individual preference

// Centralized Version Control is a type of version Control
// where if one user is using the file, the file was made
// inaccessible to other people requesting access

// In CVC system there used to be one copy with master system
// which was updated with latest changes and in order to update 
// history you need to check in with master repository

// TFS is a version control that allows isolation of content

// With rise Distributed Version Control there is no locking
// of resources which means two people can make changes at
// the same time. Also we can push and pull stuff from other 
// people's computer, if we know their id, local copies of 
// changes and history are there and it will include all changes

// Subversion, CVS, TFS, VSS are centralized version control

// Git, Mercurial, Bazaar are distributed version control
