            What is this?<br/>
            The English Language and Communication program is a program designed to improve 
            communication skills of students to assist them with effective communication of
            their thought during lectures, on and off-campus events, and amongst their peers
            representing diverse cultures and communities. 
        </p>

        <p>Why do I need this?<br/>
           It seems that your toefl score wasn't good enough to live upto our institutions 
           requirement for english proficiency and we feel that not having met our institutions 
           requirement for english proficiency will cause problem for you in successfully performing 
           your day-to-day task during your stay in States. 
        </p>
        
        <p>What is the total duration of program?<br/>
           The duration of program depends on how low your toefl score is, depending on your toefl score you
           are placed into ELC-71, ELC-81, ELC-91. If you are in ELC-81 or ELC-91 the total duration for 
           ELC program for you is first semester at stevens. But if you are in ELC-71 the total duration
           for your program is two semester and while being in ELC-81 or ELC-91 doesn't cost course credit
           to be counted towards your degree being in ELC-71 costs you credit towards your degree
        </p>
        
        <p>How much it would cost me?<br/>
           From financial prospect these course would cost you nothing as long as you are taking completing
           these courses in the first semester and your total number of credits is within 12 credits. From
           time perspect ELC-81 and ELC-91 students are required to take two classes of one hour each per week
           for one semester but ELC-71 students are required to take two classes of two hours each per week for two semesters 
        </p>
        
        <p>I feel I have required proficiency, can I skip the program?<br/>
           If you feel that you have required proficiency and don't need these sessions, we request you to retake 
           the toefl and show us your most recent score or you can enroll yourself for our English Communications
           Proficiency Examination which will cost you $50 but if you clear the examination, you will be exempted
           from taking the course
        </p>

        <p>What if I don't take it?<br/>
           If you don't take the test or sessions then we cannot be assured that you have the required proficiency
           and we won't be able to award your degree in a timely manner even if you excelled in all your courses
