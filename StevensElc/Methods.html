            Beck's Book Club:<br/>
            Joining Book Club was one of the great decision I made in Fall 2016. 
            I always wanted to be the part of such a club where we can talk about 
            anything and everything, share our views, and listen to views of others.
            Finally having got that opportunity, I always enjoyed that 
            one hour with professor and fellow peers.<br/><br/> 
            We started our Fall 2016 journey from "Twenty Great American Stories". 
            The first story we read was 'The gift of Magi' and it was really the heart 
            touching story and we could easily relate it to our life our club discussions
            used to be about how two characters who managed to buy the christmas gift for their 
            loved ones realized that it's not about the happiness in giving presents to
            loved ones, instead it's about the love they share and which was what made their life 
            happy and comforting irrespective of whether they had money in their pockets or not.<br/><br/> 
            This story and discussion brings a real change in me, it made me realize that 
            we should run towards materialistic things to make someone feel special 
            rather we should share love, emotion and happiness between each other 
            because this is what makes our bond stronger. We read more amazing short 
            stories and each story always had something to learn from. Book club didn't 
            only help us in improving our conversation skills but it also helped us as 
            a person. I am looking forward to be the part of book club in my next 
            semester too.<br/>

            Conversation Beyond Borders:<br/>
            This is one of many methods we adopt to help students improve their communication skills. 
            We understand life as an international student or scholar can be both incredibly exciting 
            and nail bitingly challenging. Hence we crafted this program to provide international 
            students with precious opportunity to connect and share their experience and problems with 
            students, scholars, and staff members from around the world who are local and/or have gone 
            through similar problems. <br/><br/>The discussion here ranges from a wide variety of topics such as 
            getting settled in states to knowing and getting acclimate with the locals and aliens 
            representing different communities and countries in this american ecosystem. All of the 
            stevens members are welcome to attend any of the many sessions, and without any prior 
            registration.<br/>

            Language Lab:<br/>
            Alike other methods, this method also helps students improve their communication skills in 
            a way that, language lab is equipped with state-of-the-art and for credit to be awarded to 
            a student, it is required that each student takes at a minimum one session of one hour from 
            day 1 up until last day of semester and get the attendance card duly signed by lab assistant.<br/><br/>
            The way I found out this method to be having impact on myself is, the condition of credit being 
            awarded compels student to go and take the session no matter and after the student has taken
            5 sessions, the students himself starts to realize mistakes they were making and importance of
            the session and starts to walk on path of fixing grammatical mistakes deep rooted in his/her 
            character thus improving one's own communication skills as well as analytical capabilities. 
            Additionally, once you have successfully completed 30 sessions or more the most effective change 
            is you are punctual and develop a sense of responsibility. The sessions for most cases act as 
            motivational force and they give meaning to your dull life. <br/><br/>
            One small incident I would like to share is back in August'15 when I came I was apprehensive 
            of talking in english, not because I thought I didn't knew but because I never spoke and for most 
            of us people english is not the first language but I still remember words of recruiter from career
            fair, the words as is were "I like your confidence and energy, don't loose it and keep it coming".
            And it was until January 2017 that is after I have graduated in December 2016, that he remembers me 
            and I get recruitment call from that company stating that senior recruiter has ask the interviewer 
            to get in touch with me and see if I am available to join. I would like to mention the change 
            was so much positive that my parents credit stevens for making me take that course as they know how 
            bad my communication skills were and how improved they were post my first semester at stevens.<br/>

            International Cabaret Night and International Dance Night:<br/>
            While International Cabaret Night takes places every year during fall semester, International Dance Night 
            is it's counterpart and takes place during spring semesters, both event introduce members of the community
            and stevens family with cultural practices and cuisine offerings from various different cultures. The event 
            are highly soughted after events amongst students and help many student improve their public speaking and 
            time management skills by means of providing them with volunteering opportunities thus helping them develop 
            volunteering and charitable nature which are some of the rare traits of human personality these days.<br/><br/>
            The event is an opportunity for ELC students to take a break from mundane academic responsibilities 
            and improve their skills to socialize, communicate with other members of the stevens family and further
            provide them with a platform to showcase their talent and explore their interests thus making a student 
            more confident about ones ownself and help him with overall personality development. The only rule of 
            thumb we follow here is communication is to be strictly in english due to the fact that it's a diverse 
            environment and the more people are able to understand what anyone is saying the more comforting they will 
            find the environment and further they will be able to add to your piece of information which someday in 
            future will eventually help you. <br/>
            <br/>
