            Footstompers International Dance Organization.<br/>
            Footstompers International Dance Organization also known as FIDO is an on campus club where culture
            meets dance lovers. The idea behind the group is bring together likeminded people from various cultures 
            and provide them a platform to think out of the box, and innovate a dance form that has never been heard  
            or seen before and that is educates viewers about cultural practices, ideologies and interests followed in
            a culture and community and also help them realize value of teamspirit, and unity in real world by 
            working as team to innovate a form, tackle the issues and reap the pleasure<br/><br/>

            The group was introduced in Fall'15 and is now 16 months old, and as we are young there is plenty 
            of room for creativity, and innovation and we highly encourage students to join the group and 
            pursue their passion for dance once in a while to take a break, pursue their interest and let 
            the world realize that it's the creativity with academic excellence what's makes ducks so special.<br/><br/>

            Thanks !<br/>

            Student Language Exchange Club<br/>
            Student Language Exchange Club also known as SLEC is an on campus club where we organize events 
            to accumulate grad students from totally different countries and cultures to collaborate
            with each other, kinda like open discussions on almost any topic.<br/><br/>
            
            Additionally, we share our knowledge on different cultures, some standard etiquettes in the States 
            and ask to put their input into it as well to spread a word of knowledge, we (officials) 
            also make sure to engage them with extra activities like games, music and movie to entertain 
            them whilst having fun of meeting new people, and of course free food.<br/><br/>

            Furthermore, in Fall '16, we organized an event of food festival event under International Education 
            month for entire Stevens Community where we managed to bring food from 8 different countries and to 
            our surprise, we had a head count of 250+ individuals. We couldn't thank OGSA and Stevens community 
            with volunteers enough for their constant support and participation without them it won't be possible. 
            We were overwhelmed to be a part of it.<br/><br/>

            Thanks !<br/>
