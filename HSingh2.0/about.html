		 <b><p>Note of Thanks:</p></b>
			<p>Hi, my name is harshit singh and I would like to thank you for having visited my website.
			Now that you have visited this website, I am sure you are one of the two people for whom this
			website has been designed. So, then why delay lets gets started and make your visit to this 
			website fruitful.</p><br/>
	<b><p>Personally Speaking:</p></b>
			<p>Born in the month of march, in a rajput family, with father being a professor and mother 
			being a housewive. I am recognized as harbinger of happiness for my family due to some personal 
			reasons. </p><br/>
		<b><p>Professionally Speaking:</p></b>
			<p>In this section I will only tell what's not in my resume. If you have gone through this section 
			I would be happy if you would have a look at my resume which you will find under resume section on 
			the left hand side of the page you are looking at.</p><br/>
			<b><p>Academics:</p></b>
			<p>Talking about academics as its a crucial aspect of one's professional life, I would clearly 
		    like to mention that I have never been extraordinarily brilliant. My primary education was courtesy 
			of my alma mater which happens to be reknowned education institution of the city where I was born. 
		    My secondary school education also was courtesy of my alma mater which though didn't happened to be 
		    extremely reknowned, still had gem like professor who knew how to make diamonds out of stone. My 
		    undergrad alma mater happened to be one of the reknowned and extremely supportive institution of the 
			state from where I came.</p>
			<p>It happened so, that I don't know how but all the achievements that happened to be a part of my 
			life and are mentioned under the activity column of my resume achieved/or were pursued while I was 
		    pursuing my bachelor's. It is of the many primary reasons why I believe my undergrad alma matter was 
		    extremely supportive because it happened so that for most part of the time whenever I was being introduced 
			to opportunities, the source of information about the opportunities was my undergrad alma matter.
			I happened to get attach to people/organization very quickly, though I am capable of getting results
			on standalone basis, I prefer working in groups and that too preferably with people from diverse culture.
			</p><br/>
			<b><p>Strength:</p></b>
			<p>Speaking about my USP, I would say I am still learning more and more about myself. But based on what
			I have learned about myself till the today, I would say following are my USP</p>
			<p>1. I take pleasure in talking about something and taking up initiatives</p>
			<p>2. I am good in memory as in really good, for most of the time like probably 80% of the cases, 
			if I see something, the possibility is about 10% that I will forget.</p>
			<p>3. I am pretty good in convincing people, saying in terms of I will get it done what needs to be done</p>
			<p>4. I am enthusiastic to learn new things and usually do whatever it takes to learn something</p>
			<p>5. I am trustworthy and if anything comes into my ears, there is a possibility of 0.01% of that being 
			leaked note that this 0.01% includes cases where I believe either I will end up in serious problem or someone 
			else may end up in problem if I heldback the information.</p><br/>
