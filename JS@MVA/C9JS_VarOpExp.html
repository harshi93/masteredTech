In javascript when you want mention something in inverted commas without using + sign the best ways 
is to have backslash before the inverted commas and 
backslash after inverted commas, like 

"My name is "harshit singh", I am doing good" won't 
actually work but "My name is \"harshit singh"\, I am doing good will actually work
